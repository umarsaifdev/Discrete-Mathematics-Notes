📘 Discrete Mathematics
Welcome to the Discrete Mathematics Notes — designed for Computer Science & AI students who want to finally understand math in simple words.

Why this repo exists

Most students struggle with Discrete Mathematics because it feels abstract, filled with symbolic logic, and disconnected from real-world applications. This repo fixes that.
I’ve modified these notes using the Richard Feynman Technique — breaking down complex concepts into plain, simple language so you can explain them as if teaching a friend.

What you’ll find here

✅ Lecture notes (PDFs, step-by-step)
✅ Concepts simplified with the Feynman method
✅ Direct links to video lectures for Urdu/Hindi Speakers
✅ A roadmap from the basics → advanced topics in Discrete Mathematics

Who this is for

Students in CS, AI, and Engineering

Self-learners tired of “rote learning”

Anyone who wants to finally build intuition in logic, proofs, and discrete structures

How to use this repo

Watch the lecture video if you are an Urdu/Hindi Speaker 🎥

Follow along, pause, and review

Try explaining the concept in your own words (Feynman style)

Apply the concepts to problems in your field

💡 This isn’t just math. It’s the foundation of computer science, algorithms, and AI — explained the way you wish someone had taught you.
